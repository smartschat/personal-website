I'm a senior digital expert at [BASF](https://www.basf.com/), where I work on natural language processing and artificial intelligence problems.

Before, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Computational Linguistics department](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/) of [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de), where I worked with [Katja Markert](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~markert/). I obtained my PhD from Heidelberg University, conducting my research at the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org), where my advisor was [Michael Strube](https://michael.kimstrube.de).
